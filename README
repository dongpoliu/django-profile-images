django-profile-images
=====================

Installing
==========

To use django-profile-images in your project, copy the 'profileimages' 
folder somewhere on your path (usually inside your application 
directory). You will need to add this application to your 
INSTALLED_APPS settings variable.

You will also need to define the following settings variables:

# the directory for uploaded profile images
PROFILE_IMAGE_UPLOAD_DIR = 'img/profiles/'

# the maximum size for uploaded images in kilobytes
PROFILE_IMAGE_MAX_SIZE = 64

# the default profile image for users who haven't uploaded one yet
PROFILE_IMAGE_DEFAULT = 'img/profiles/default.png'

Using
=====

You'll probably want to define a template called 'profileimages/image_upload.html'
which has your upload form. A sample is included to get you started.

You can also get a user's profile image in a template by doing:

{% load profile_images %}

{% profile_image user 64x64 %}

This will include an appropriate image tag for the user's profile image.
